# Swagger 

Command: ``swag init`` create 3 files: 
1. `docs.go`: This file contains the generated documentation in Go code format. It includes structs and functions that describe your API endpoints, their parameters, response models, and other relevant information.
2. `swagger.json`: This file is a JSON representation of your API documentation in the Swagger format (also known as OpenAPI specification). It provides a standardized way to describe your API endpoints, their inputs, outputs, and other metadata.
3. `swagger.yaml`: This file is similar to `swagger.json` but is written in YAML format instead of JSON. It serves the same purpose of documenting your API in the Swagger format, but in a human-readable format.
